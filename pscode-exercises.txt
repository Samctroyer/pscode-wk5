// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

n1 + n2 = sum

print sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

enter int

remainder = int%2

if remainder = 0 print "even"

else print "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a. add n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 

b. (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 = avg

c. 

n1 = min

compare each integer to n1 and declare it min if smaller than n1

(if n2 < n1 
	then n2 = min
	else n1 = min) 

same for following integers

Same idea for max

n1 = max 

if n2 > n1 
	then n2 = max
	else n1 = max

d. 
print "The average of these numbers is:"
print avg

print "The highest of these numbers is:"
print max

print "The lowest of these numbers is:"
print min



a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
